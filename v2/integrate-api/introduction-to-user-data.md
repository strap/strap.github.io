The following Report API endpoints return data specific to users who have connected their wearable or health app to your project. 

User data calls can accept a GUID parameter to return data for a specific user, or in some cases multiple comma separated GUIDs for multiple users.

Others enable paginated results to step through the entire set of users in your project.
