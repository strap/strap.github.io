Strap makes it simple to gather, analyze, and take action on data from wearables and health apps.

With **Strap Integrate**, developers can use a single SDK to enable users to connect their favorite wearables and health apps. Once users sync their wearable and health data, it is made available through the **Reports API** for display in application interfaces.
