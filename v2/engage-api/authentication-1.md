Each Engage API instance is sandboxed and siloed per customer. Before you can make calls the Engage API, your Strap account rep will provide you with a URL and Token for Engage API access. 

Once you have an Engage API URL and Token, simply set set an HTTP header for x-token equal to your Engage API token.
